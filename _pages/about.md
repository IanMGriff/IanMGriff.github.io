I'm Ian, an AI researcher at Meta using foundation models to improve perceptual models used in production models and on device applications. I'm also a computational neuroscientist finishing my PhD at [Harvard](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/) and [MIT](https://bcs.mit.edu/) in the [Labratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/index.html). Previously, I worked with [Liberty Hamilton](https://www.hamiltonlab.org/), and have a background in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley, where I worked at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/).

### Research
I'm broadly interested in studying minds and machines to better understand the principles of intelligence, with the aim of improving machines. Recently, I've been using auditory perception to explore how properties of biological attention can emerge in artificial systems.
