I'm Ian, an AI and computational neuroscientist finishing my PhD at [Harvard](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/) and [MIT](https://bcs.mit.edu/) in the [Labratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/index.html). Previously, I worked with [Liberty Hamilton](https://www.hamiltonlab.org/), and have a background in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley, where I worked at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/).

__Currently, I'm interning at Meta Reality Labs as a Research Scientist.__

### Research
I'm broadly interested in studying minds and machines to uncover shared principles of intelligence. Recently, I've been using auditory perception to explore how properties of biological attention can emerge in artificial systems.
