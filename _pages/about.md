I'm Ian, an AI researcher and Computational Neuroscientist at Meta Reality Labs building human-level perceptual models. I'm finishing my PhD at [Harvard](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/) and [MIT](https://bcs.mit.edu/) in the [Labratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/index.html). Previously, I worked with [Liberty Hamilton](https://www.hamiltonlab.org/), and have a background in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley, where I worked at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). I've also been lucky enough to collaborate with the [Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/). 

## Research
I'm broadly interested in studying minds and machines to better understand the principles of intelligence, to improve artificial systems and better understand humans. 

### Auditory attention & "the cocktail party problem"
Human brains can selectively focus on a single voice amid background noises and other talkers, a capacity that has been difficult to reproduce in artificial systems. In our upcoming [Nature Human Behavior](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.28.656682) paper, we examine how human-like auditory attention can emerge in artificial models if they are equipped with biologically-inspired attention mechanisms and trained for the cocktail party problem.
