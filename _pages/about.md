I am a PhD student in the [Harvard-MIT Program in Speech and Hearing Biosciences and Technology](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/). I am currently working with Josh McDermott in the [Labratory for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/index.html). Previously, I was a research assistant with [Liberty Hamilton](https://slhs.utexas.edu/research/hamilton-lab), and recieved my undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley.

Research
------
I'm broadly interested in how the human brain translates sounds into perception, and creating artificial systems that can do the same. I'm also interested in using computational models of perception to improve hearing assistive devices and other audio technologies.

I currently study how deep neural networks can be used to make human-like models of speech recognition. While seemingly simple, speech recognition is a surprisingly difficult computational task. How the human brain solves this task is still not fully understood.

About
------
Outside of lab, I like to split my free time between guitar, music production, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (give it a try if you haven't).

Contact
------
If you'd like to reach out, please email me! I'm more than happy to talk about the (non-linear) path to grad school, general science, and all things sound and hearing.
